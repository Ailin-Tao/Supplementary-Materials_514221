Supplementary Materials for “Lipidomics Reveals Common Mechanisms in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion, and Infertility: A Genetic-Based Analysis”
This repository contains supplementary figures and data supporting the manuscript titled:
“Lipidomics Reveals Common Mechanisms in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion, and Infertility: A Genetic-Based Analysis”

Due to file size and format restrictions during the submission, the supplementary figures were not included in the main submission. This repository provides access to all supplementary figures and related data in compressed (.zip) format, offering a more comprehensive view of the findings presented in the manuscript.

File Structure
The repository contains the following files and folders:

Supplementary tables.xlsx
This file includes detailed data and statistical results that support the findings of the manuscript.
It contains the following tables:
sTable1: Lipidome Index Number and Name Correspondence Table
sTable2: Summary of Mendelian Randomization Results and Sensitivity Analysis (PCOS)
sTable3: Summary of Mendelian Randomization Results and Sensitivity Analysis (Infertility)
sTable4: Summary of Mendelian Randomization Results and Sensitivity Analysis (RSA)
These tables provide deeper insight into the statistical analysis and lipidomic profiles, which could not be included in the main manuscript due to space constraints.

Figure Descriptions
Forest Plots: Visualize the effect sizes and confidence intervals for the genetic variants associated with lipidomic traits, providing insights into genetic associations across the diseases.
Funnel Plots: Assess potential publication bias or heterogeneity in the results, helping ensure the robustness and reliability of the analysis.
Leave-One-Out (LOO) Plots: Demonstrate the robustness of the results by iteratively removing one genetic variant at a time and observing its impact on the overall findings.
Scatter Plots: Show the relationship between genetic instruments and lipidomic traits, providing a clear visual representation of the genetic-lipidomic correlations.

Notes for Reviewers
All supplementary figures are organized by disease/condition (Infertility, PCOS, RSA).
Scatter Plots depict the causal relationships between lipidomics and the risks of the three reproductive disorders, while Funnel Plot analysis showed no significant heterogeneity. Furthermore, Leave-One-Out analysis demonstrated that excluding any individual SNP did not substantially alter the MR results, reinforcing the robustness of the causal inference.
